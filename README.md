In the projects for this course, I focused on analyzing the efficiency of different data structures and implementing sorting algorithms to organize and display a list of courses in the Computer Science program. The first project involved evaluating the run-time and memory usage of various data structures, helping me understand how choices like arrays, linked lists, and hash tables impact performance. The second project required implementing an efficient sorting algorithm to arrange course data in alphanumeric order, reinforcing my understanding of algorithmic complexity and data organization.

To approach these problems, I carefully selected data structures that provided the best balance of time complexity and memory efficiency for each task. Understanding the trade-offs between different structures was crucial in making informed decisions. For example, when sorting and printing course data, I considered how different sorting algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort, would perform in terms of efficiency and stability. Throughout the process, I encountered roadblocks, such as handling edge cases where course identifiers contained mixed numeric and alphabetic characters. Debugging and refining my sorting logic helped me develop stronger problem-solving skills and reinforced the importance of writing test cases to validate different scenarios.

Working on these projects expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing efficiency, organization, and clarity. I learned to evaluate performance trade-offs more critically and apply structured problem-solving techniques when selecting and implementing data structures. Additionally, these projects refined my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. By using clear variable names, modular functions, and proper documentation, I ensured that my code was easy to understand and modify in the future. This experience reinforced best practices that I will carry forward into more complex software development projects.
